                        <p>The real world is noisy and sensor inputs are no exception. TrackPose is a library for realtime smoothing of various real-world inputs including perception-based tracking systems, virtual reality hand controllers, and other human-control input devices. TrackPose's theoretical guarantees ensure your robot's behavior is safer and more predictable, while prolonging the life of your hardware via smoother operation.

                        <h3>PickNik TrackJoint</h3>
                        <p>Modern robots require highly reactive machines capable of instantaneous changes. TrackJoint is a highly reactive algorithm that can deterministically compute joint-based motion trajectories in real time. This results in smoother motions that ensure expensive robot hardware's lifetime is prolonged while minimizing overall cycle time.

                        <h3>PickNik Bolt</h3>
                        <p>Robotic manipulation tasks are becoming increasingly challenging to solve by ordinary motion planners. Bolt is a fast, dual-arm motion planner that selectively learns from experience. It is also capable of solving underconstrained Cartesian trajectories. Bolt reliably produces smooth and robust motion trajectories using cutting edge theoretical proofs.
