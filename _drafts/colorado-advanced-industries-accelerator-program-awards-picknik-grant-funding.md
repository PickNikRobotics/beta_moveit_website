PickNik Robotics, a Boulder, CO-based company, has won a [$248,400 grant](https://choosecolorado.com/7-7-million-advanced-industries-awards-fuel-37-colorado-start-ups/) from Coloradoâ€™s Office of Economic Development & International Trade [Advanced Industries Accelerator Grant Program](https://choosecolorado.com/doing-business/incentives-financing/advanced-industries/) to support development of a new mixed autonomy robot arm solution called MoveIt Studio that aims to address advanced industrial and commercial applications by leveraging mixed autonomy.

MoveIt Studio will be built on top of the popular MoveIt platform that is used by robotics companies around the world. PickNik, a leader in robotic motion planning and control, has identified a need in deploying complex manipulation robots to real world problems: the ability for a human to specify high level goals and have the software fill in as much as it can with minimal supervision.

While MoveIt Studio is currently being developed for NASA's Robonaut2 program operating on the international space, with the support of the Advanced Industries Accelerator Grant Program, PickNik is looking to address commercial, terrestrial customers applications such as robots that assist with home cleaning, healthcare, demolition and construction, and maintenance in high security and high risk environments.

PickNik will continue to grow their open source MoveIt platform, which is a key dependency of their premium MoveIt Studio product. PickNik is very excited about the diverse applications that MoveIt Studio will enable, and supported by this most recent grant award, hope it will greatly extend their existing robotic software offerings.
