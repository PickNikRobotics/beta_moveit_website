                <p>
                    Before launching a large project with a new client, we have found it beneficial to our clients to conduct
                    a small fixed-price consulting engagement that generates an in-depth Feasibility Study report. This
                    allows both parties to test the waters and fully understand each other. You are of course free to use the
                    report internally or with other service providers without further engaging in PickNik.

                        Our Feasibility Studies are a low fixed rate fee, which we believe to be a great value for the brain dump
                        of tailored knowledge we provide. Our legal contract to get started is a simple 1 page engagement
                        letter.
