                        We are highly efficient in working remotely, ensuring your experience feels like our team is always in the office with you. Our proven model consists of weekly email summaries, weekly or bi-weekly video calls, and daily Github/Slack/etc online communication. Depending on the project we can travel for occasional onsites, have representative hardware shipped to us, or develop full featured simulations.
