                <p>
                    PickNik's on-demand consulting, support, and code debugging offering provides a flexible and lightweight alternative to larger scoped projects. These types of engagements are typical after a larger code development effort has ended, or after a <a href="/docs/PickNik_Phase_0_Feasibility_Study_Overview.pdf" target="_blank">Phase 0 Feasibility Study</a> is completed but the larger effort is not ready to begin yet.

                    <p>
                        PickNik enjoys working with your robotics engineers in co-development, mentoring, and training as you build your next ROS application. We can collaborate remotely via periodic video calls, email, and online messaging. Optionally, we can collaborate onsite where we work one-on-one with your team providing hands-on ROS mentoring, architecting, and strategy.
