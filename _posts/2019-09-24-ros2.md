Earlier this year, PickNik conducted a series of interviews with both ROS users and non-ROS users. This report summarizes those interviews conducted for Amazon Web Services and the ROS 2 Technical Steering Committee (TSC). It is guided by Amazonâ€™s customer-focused approach
to developing their product specifications, and is intended to inform future ROS 2 resource allocations after the December 2018 ROS Crystal, the third release of ROS 2.

We used the collected data to rank, in order of importance, the key takeaways of the community. The following, in descending order, are the results of that effort:

* Robustness and Reliability
* Powerful & Easy to Use Debugging Tools
* ROS Master as Single Point of Failure
* Leverage More Best-Practices
* Distributed/Multi-Robot Systems Support
* Cloud-Enabled Capabilities
* Lifecycle Management
* Deployment to Production
* Security
