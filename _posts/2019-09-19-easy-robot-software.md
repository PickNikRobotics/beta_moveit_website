**Intro Paragraph, high-level**

Check out Dave Coleman's ROSCon 2018 talk on "Easy Robot Software and the MoveIt Setup Assistant 2.0", where he discusses some of the usability design decisions of the MoveIt framework.

**Abstract**

As the capabilities of robotic software frameworks increase, the setup difficulty and learning curve for new users also increase. If the entry barriers for configuring and using the software on robots is too high, even the most powerful of frameworks are useless. A growing need exists in ROS to aid users in getting started with, and customizing, the software framework as necessary for particular robotic applications. In this talk, we will explore the MoveIt! Motion Planning Frameworkâ€™s approach to assisting new users with setup will be used as a case study into one of the challenges for pushing robotics forward.
