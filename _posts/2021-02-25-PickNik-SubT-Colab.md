PickNik is excited to announce that we’ve teamed up with Coordinated Robotics to assist in navigation and perception in the DARPA Subterranean challenge.

Team Coordinated Robotics is a repeat winner of the [DARPA Subterranean Challenge competition, ](https://www.subtchallenge.com/)including most recently the 3rd round in October 2020. The team lead and primary contributor is Kevin Knoedler, but to prepare for the final event in Fall 2021, Kevin has reached out to PickNik Robotics to leverage our expert team of roboticists and win the final round.

PickNik’s David Lu and John Stechschulte will be working with Mr. Knoedler for the final virtual challenge to be held SEP 21-23, 2021. You can find out more about the teams in the challenge and how the competition takes place at [here](https://www.subtchallenge.com/teams.html).
