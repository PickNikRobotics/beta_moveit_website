This past summer saw the beginning of the port of MoveIt to ROS 2.0 along with a number of plans for its roadmap. Along with this, MoveIt had a few style changes. Namely the "!" was dropped from the name (RIP) and is no longer used. There's more on that <a href="https://moveit.ros.org/about/press_kit/" target="_blank">here</a>.
In light of that and in preparation for World MoveIt Day, we've decided that style changes should be done in style ;)

Official MoveIt gear is available now. Featuring the new logo, MoveIt gear includes the choices of:

1- A MoveIt hoodie to keep you warm and cozy this winter

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/images/blog_posts/moveit_gear/hoodie.jpg" alt="hoodie"></div>
<br>

2- A comfy t-shirt for whatever occasion

Order <a href="https://teespring.com/shop/moveit-tee-hoodie?tsmac=recently_viewed&tsmic=recently_viewed&pid=369&cid=6513" target="_blank">here</a> and support the open source robotics community! Proceeds will be used for the maintenance of MoveIt.
