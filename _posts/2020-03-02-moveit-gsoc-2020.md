We are pleased to announce that for the first time, MoveIt has been selected as a mentor organization for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC). GSoC is an international program in which Google awards stipends to students who complete a free and open-source software coding project during a three month period. Details about the program can be found <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline" target="_blank">here</a>

Ideas for possible projects are listed <a href="https://moveit.ros.org/documentation/contributing/future_projects/" target="_blank">here</a>. If you are a student who enjoys working on MoveIt, this is your chance. At a minimum you should have experience with ROS. Ideally, you have also worked with MoveIt before. Almost all projects require experience with programming in C++. Now is the time to discuss your interest in a particular project on Discourse or, when appropriate, on Github. I highly recommend to engage with the MoveIt community before submitting an application.

We are excited to see the progress made this summer!
