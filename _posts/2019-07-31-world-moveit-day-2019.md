**The fourth annual World MoveIt Day will be Wednesday, November 20th, 2019!**

The event is a day long international hackathon to improve the MoveIt code base, increase documentation, and discuss  exciting developments in our community. Everyone is welcome to join, whether to host, participate, or just observe.

We hope to close as many pull requests and issues as possible and explore new areas of features and improvements building off of our seven years of ongoing work.
