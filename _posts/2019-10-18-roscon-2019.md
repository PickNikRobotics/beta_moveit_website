PickNik Robotics is proud to be a sponsor of ROSCon 2019 Macau, October 31 - November 1, 2019.

ROSCon is the place for ROS developers to come together to learn from and network with the ROS community. Featuring tips and tricks from experts and opportunities to discuss and share ideas with fellow developers, ROSCon is the place to be.
